## Assignment

### Booth's multiplication algorithm

You need to implement Booth's multiplication algorithm in LC-3 machine language or in LC-3 assembly language. Your code will read two 16-bit numbers (in the range -128 to 127) from predetermined memory locations, multiply those two numbers using Booth's multiplication algorithm, and save the result as a 16-bit number into a specified memory location.
You can find Booth's multiplication algorithm description on Wikipedia

#### Specific Requirements

- Your code must be written in the LC-3 assembly language or in LC-3 machine language.
- Your code must begin at memory location x3000.
- Your inputs must be located at memory locations x3F00 and x3F01 and your output must be stored in memory at address x3FFF.
- Your program must use a loop.
- You may only use at most 50 LC-3 instructions (not including the input/output numbers).
- Your code must be commented properly.
- To submit you code, add js folder to your svn repository and commit the code to svn.
